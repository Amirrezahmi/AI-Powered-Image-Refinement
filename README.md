# AI-Powered-Image-Refinement
In this repo, you'll learn how I used AI tools (like Nano-banana) to redesign a date box: enhancing its layout, adding elements, upscaling quality, and creating a unique, polished final product from an initial inspiration.


Here is the inspiration product: a date box design I liked. I wanted to create my own version with custom improvements and a fresh look.

</p>

I used the Nano-banana model (accessible in Google Gemini) to isolate the main front panel of the date box.

Click the üçå (image) icon, upload your photo, and use the prompt:
`Extract only the large main rectangular front panel of this packaging, with a clean, flat output.`

The result is a perfectly cropped, high-quality version of the main face, ready for redesign.

Since the image quality from Gemini‚Äôs output is often low, I use AirBrush‚Äôs AI Repair feature to enhance every generated image. This significantly improves clarity, detail, and overall readiness for professional use.

To clean up the text inside circular areas where the AI didn‚Äôt perform well, I used the Eraser and AI Eraser tools in AirBrush. This effectively clears the area, making it easy to add custom text later in any design software with the font of your choice.

Since I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the original date container (especially its base), I used Gemini‚Äôs image editor again to enhance it - making the container more elegant and giving it a richer, golden appearance.

Since the border around the image wasn‚Äôt well-rendered by Gemini, I prompted Gemini again to replace it with a more elegant and visually appealing border. The output was significantly improved.

And remember: I consistently use the AI Enhance or AI Repair tool in AirBrush to upscale and refine the image quality after each editing step.

Since I was still not satisfied with the image quality, I used Canva‚Äôs Image Enhancer tool to significantly increase the resolution - boosting it from 300 KB to 4 MB.

I also made sure to export the final design from Canva at the highest possible quality setting for a crisp, professional result.
In the final step, I used Gemini once more to generate a more beautiful background inside the circle - creating a stylish date-themed design to fill the space perfectly.
